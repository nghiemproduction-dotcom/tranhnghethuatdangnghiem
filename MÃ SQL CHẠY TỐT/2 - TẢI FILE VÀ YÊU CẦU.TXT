SOURCE CODE CONTEXT: 
I have uploaded or pasted the COMPLETE content of all requested files from the previous analysis step. You MUST work exclusively based on these provided files and any Supabase SQL check results I mentioned.

EXECUTION RULES - FOLLOW STRICTLY WITH NO EXCEPTIONS:

1. NO LAZY CODING - ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN:
   - Never use placeholders like // ..., /* ... */, "rest of the code", empty backticks, or any form of abbreviation.
   - You MUST output the COMPLETE, VERBATIM, SYNTAX-CORRECT code that can be directly "Select All → Copy → Paste" replaced without any further editing.

2. INTEGRITY & LENGTH CONTROL:
   - Estimate token length before generating.
   - If a file is too long for one response, stop at a clean logical boundary (end of function, class, SQL block, Vue component, etc.) and wait for my "Continue" or "Next" command.
   - NEVER break syntax mid-line or mid-block.

3. SAFETY & ARCHITECTURE PROTECTION:
   - DO NOT add new imports, packages, helpers, traits, middleware, or Supabase client methods unless they already exist in the provided files or I explicitly request them.
   - DO NOT change folder structure or framework conventions.

4. IRON RULE - DATABASE-FIRST & NO FRONTEND HARDCODING:
   - All static data (lists, options, labels, messages, statuses, roles, categories, settings, display texts, etc.) MUST be stored in the backend:
     • Supabase tables with proper RLS
     • Config or env files
   - Hardcoding any such data in frontend files (Vue components, Pinia stores, JS/TS constants, fake enums, etc.) is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.
   - If existing frontend hardcoding is found → migrate it to Supabase tables and provide full SQL migration + RLS policies.
   - Frontend must only fetch data via Supabase client or Laravel API.

5. SUPABASE INTEGRATION RULES - STRICTLY ENFORCED:
   - All schema changes, RLS, and bucket operations MUST be done via raw SQL compatible with Supabase.
   - You MUST provide:
     • Complete SQL migration files (named like 20251225_create_table.sql) with CREATE TABLE / ALTER TABLE / ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY / CREATE POLICY / DROP POLICY IF EXISTS, etc.
     • Verification SQL queries to check before and after applying changes
     • SQL for creating buckets and policies if needed (INSERT INTO storage.buckets ...)
   - Always enable RLS and define explicit policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE based on auth.uid() or role.
   - Never assume existing RLS or buckets.

6. RESPONSE LANGUAGE RULES - MANDATORY:
   - ALL explanations, change descriptions, reasoning, and logic analysis MUST BE IN VIETNAMESE ONLY.
   - Code comments may follow the existing project style (English or Vietnamese).
   - The progress table and NEXT ACTION section must use Vietnamese for notes and instructions.

7. MANDATORY PROGRESS REPORT:
   - At the very end of every response, you MUST include this exact Markdown table:

NEXT ACTION: [Clear instruction in Vietnamese, e.g., "Copy các đoạn code trên vào file tương ứng. Chạy các SQL migration trên Supabase Dashboard trước khi test, sau đó gõ 'Next' để tiếp tục", or "Hoàn tất tất cả file. Hãy chạy migration và kiểm tra tính năng"]

START IMPLEMENTATION IMMEDIATELY. NO EXTRA INTRODUCTION OR SMALL TALK.
