SOURCE CODE CONTEXT: I have provided the content of the requested files above.

EXECUTION RULES (STRICTLY FOLLOW):

NO LAZY CODING: You are strictly forbidden from using placeholders like // ... rest of code, // ... existing code, or ``. You must output the FULL, VERBATIM CODE capable of a direct "Select All -> Copy -> Paste" replacement.

INTEGRITY CHECK: Before generating, estimate the token count. If the file is too long for a single response, stop logically at a function boundary and wait for my "Continue" command. Do not break syntax mid-air.

SAFETY: Do not hallucinate imports. Ensure the new code does not conflict with the existing architecture visible in the provided files.

RESPONSE LANGUAGE: Explain your logic in VIETNAMESE. Code comments can be in English or Vietnamese (your choice).

MANDATORY PROGRESS REPORT: At the very end of your response, you MUST append a status block in Markdown:
