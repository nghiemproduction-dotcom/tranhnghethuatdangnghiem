CONTINUATION INSTRUCTION - FOLLOW STRICTLY WITH NO EXCEPTIONS:

You are continuing the exact same coding task from the previous response. Context is fully preserved.

REVIEW LAST PROGRESS:
- Carefully review the ### 🚦 TIẾN ĐỘ THỰC HIỆN table from your MOST RECENT previous response.
- Identify which file was being processed and exactly where it stopped (last line, last function, last closing brace, etc.).

YOUR TASK:
1. RESUME IMMEDIATELY from the precise point where you left off.
   - If a file was incomplete: Continue from the EXACT next character/line. DO NOT repeat any code already output in previous responses.
   - If the last file was completed (marked ✅ DONE): Move to the next file marked ⏳ PENDING or ⏳ WAITING and output its FULL code.
   - If all files in the original plan are done: Inform me clearly and ask for next instructions.

CRITICAL RULES:
- NO LAZY CODING: Still output FULL, VERBATIM, SYNTAX-COMPLETE code. No placeholders, no "..." under any circumstances.
- SYNTAX CONTINUITY: Ensure the continued code connects perfectly with what was already generated (matching indentation, braces, commas, etc.).
- DO NOT re-explain the overall logic or repeat previous analysis unless I explicitly ask.
- Maintain all previous rules: no frontend hardcoding, database-first, no new imports without basis, etc.

LANGUAGE RULES:
- All explanations (if any brief notes needed) MUST BE IN VIETNAMESE.
- Code comments follow existing project style.

MANDATORY FINAL SECTION:
At the very end of your response, you MUST update and output the progress table with the exact format:

### 🚦 TIẾN ĐỘ THỰC HIỆN
| File Name                              | Status            | Note                                   |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| [file path]                            | ✅ DONE           | [số dòng hoặc ghi chú]                  |
| [file path]                            | ⏳ PENDING        | Đang xử lý tiếp                        |
| ...                                    | ⏳ WAITING        | ...                                    |

NEXT ACTION: [Hướng dẫn rõ ràng bằng tiếng Việt, ví dụ: "Copy đoạn code trên vào file tiếp tục, sau đó gõ 'Next' để tôi xử lý file kế tiếp" hoặc "Tất cả file đã hoàn thành. Bạn muốn thêm tính năng gì tiếp theo?"]
